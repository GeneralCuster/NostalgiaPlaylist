# NostalgiaPlaylist
Play Music Nostalgia Playlist Maker

This is a program which uses a 3rd party Google Play Music API (gmusicapi) and another 3rd party api
for billboard.com (billboard-charts) to grab a list of the top n number of songs from a given year,
find them all on play music, add them to library and then to a playlist.

Currently, it is functionally done but strings within the script must be edited for custom functionality,
unless you just want the top 100 for August 31st, 2014 to download constantly ;)

Plans for the future:
+ Implement command line arguments

+ GUI???
