# NostalgiaPlaylist
Play Music Nostalgia Playlist Maker

This is a program which uses a 3rd party Google Play Music API () and eventually the API for billboard.com to
grab a list of the top n number of songs from a given year, find them all on play music, add them to library and then
to a playlist.

Currently, it only works as far as searching a song and adding it to the library, but development is ongoing.
